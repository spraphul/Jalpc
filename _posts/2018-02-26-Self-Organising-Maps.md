In this Tutorial, we will discuss about a machine learning algorithm called Self
Organising Maps. Before we go into the details of the model, I would like to 
clear the meanings of some of the terms that we will be using further frequently.

## Supervised Learning
Let us suppose we are given a dataset in which the the input data along with the 
corresponding labels are already given. In such problems, we usually build a model 
which takes a new feature vector and outputs the most appropriate label for it and
this type of learning is called Supervised Learning.

## Unsupervised Learning
In this case we are only aware of the input feature vectors and we have no idea about 
the label corresponding to the input. In such cases, a specific set of algorithms are 
used which basically oraginises or maps the dataset in some k-dimensional plane in the 
form of clusters where each cluster represents an unique label. These types of learning
algorithms are said to be Unsupervised.
